#### Hi there 👋
My name is Indy, and I'm an Applied Math graduate 🎓 of the University of Waterloo!

When I was in school, I focused on research \:
  * analyzing protein-protein interaction data of microcephaly proteins 🔬
  * developing interpretable ML models for tumor methylomes of Medulloblastoma and Ependymoma cancers 🧠
  * simulating shallow-water magnetohydrodynamics using Oceananigans.jl 🌊


***

:hammer: I'm currently working on \: 
* carrying out research on the Variational Quantum Linear Solver 🔢
* supervising student researchers in the Quantum Ethics Project ⚛️
* working through the Foundations of Astronomical Data Science module (from Data Carpentry) 🌌
