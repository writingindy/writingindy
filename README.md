#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Indy, and I'm an Applied Math graduate ðŸŽ“ of the University of Waterloo!

When I was in school, I focused on research \:
  * analyzing protein-protein interaction data of microcephaly proteins ðŸ”¬
  * developing interpretable ML models for tumor methylomes of Medulloblastoma and Ependymoma cancers ðŸ§ 
  * simulating shallow-water magnetohydrodynamics using Oceananigans.jl ðŸŒŠ

:hammer: I'm currently working on \: 
* reading "Tidy Modeling with R" :broom:
* reading "SQL for Data Scientists" :blue_book:
* finishing up a pet project on Analyzing Letterboxd User Movie Preferences



<!--
Daft currently working on:
* working through the Foundations of Astronomical Data Science module (from Data Carpentry) ðŸŒŒ
